## **Website's name: One Horizon**

## **Introduction**

### **Project’s purpose**

This project’s objective is to generate a website that showcases intuitive and easy navigation, accessibility, responsive design and clear, well structured information.

It’s also an objective to test and validate the project using validators as W3C and Lighthouse to ensure responsiveness, accessibility, and consistency across the different devices and screen sizes.  

### **Website’s purpose**

The objective of the website is to provide key information about diversity and inclusion in the workplace/community for an unacquainted public in order to raise awareness and provide basic guidance to the public to promote such values and take action (this is for it’s MVP version).

During the planning period other features came up which could be implemented in further sprints as consultancy, education and training and support to members of minority groups.


## **Project’s Planning**


UX experience was aken into consideration the Project requirement I used user stories to create a list of specific requirements and tasks which I elaborated into a project plan. I then filtered them down to get a brief that would fit the MPV's. 
Once this was achieved I moved on to create wireframes depicting an ideation for a multi-page website layout. However due to the limitations of the project's scope for this sprint and time, everything has been build into a single page. 

### **Project’s requirements**
