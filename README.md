**Introduction**

This projectâ€™s objective is to generate a website that showcases intuitive and easy navigation, accessibility, responsive design and clear communicative well structured information.

We will also have to validate our project using validators as W3C and Jigsaw as well as creating media queries to ensure the responsiveness of the page and a consistent layout across the different devices and screen sizes.  The use of semantics in HTML will also be tested to ensure browsers can effectively find relevant information.

The project start up as single page website for the first sprint although some planning has been made showing further features that could be implemented in future sprints.
The website will be deployed at  an external git server and development will be shown through version control and commit history.

The theme of the website is diversity and inclusion and it conveys  information about this topic for an unacquainted public in order to raise awareness and provide basic guidance.
