#  Individual Project HTML and CSS
### Link: https://ali-gate.github.io/individual-formative-assignment-1/#

## **Website's name: One Horizon**

# **Introduction**

### **Project’s purpose**

This project’s objective is to generate a website that showcases intuitive and easy navigation, accessibility, responsive design and clear, well structured information.

It’s also an objective to test and validate the project using validators as W3C and Lighthouse to ensure responsiveness, accessibility, and consistency across the different devices and screen sizes.  

### **Website’s purpose**

The objective of the website is to provide key information about diversity and inclusion in the workplace/community for an unacquainted public in order to raise awareness and provide basic guidance to the public to promote such values and take action (this is for it’s MVP version).

During planning. other features were considered to  be implemented in further sprints.

# **Project’s Planning**


UX experience was taken into consideration for the design of the Project, making use of user stories to create a list of specific requirements and tasks which I elaborated into a project plan. I then filtered them down to get a brief that would fit the MPV's. 
Once this was achieved I moved on to create wireframes depicting an ideation for a multi-page website layout. However due to the limitations of the project's scope for this sprint and time, everything has been built into a single page. 

### **Project’s requirements**

 **External User’s Goal:**

The user wants to gain a basic understanding of diversity and inclusion in the workplace or educational environment. 
They seek straightforward information and tips presented in a clear, organised format.

**Site Owner’s Goal:**

The site owner aims to create a visually appealing, easy-to-navigate webpage that introduces diversity and inclusion concepts and offers basic guidance on how to implement these practices. 
The focus is on clear communication through effective use of HTML and CSS, utilising Bootstrap for layout and design.


**Target Audience:**

- Educational institutions
- Students
- Employers
- Employees
- Community groups
- Parents and Carers
- Business owners
- Community members

### **User Stories**

**User 1:**

As a user, I want to find a clear definition of diversity and inclusion so that I can understand the basic concepts.

**User Story 2:**

As an employer, I want to read about the benefits of diversity and inclusion in the workplace so that I can appreciate its importance.

**User Story 3:**

As a community member, I want to access a simple guide on how to implement diversity and inclusion practices so that I can promote these values in my environment.

**User Story 4:**

As a page owner, I want to create an attractive homepage with a clear introduction to diversity and inclusion so that users are engaged from the start.

# **Technologies**

### **Using Copilot to generate content**

Copilot's browser website was used to generate the literature and the images of the website.


### **Using GitHub Copilot**

During the development of this project, Gitpod Copilot was an invaluable tool. It assisted in generating code to structure the page's content and styling it with the help of boot strap. It also assisted suggesting improvements, and providing quick solutions to coding challenges. This allowed me to focus more on the design and functionality aspects of the project, creating a positive overall development experience.

### **Using Bootstrap**
Bootstrap was used both, with the assistance of Copilot and also manually by checking the documentation and implementing code as and when needed.### 

### **Other technologies used:**

- **Google Fonts**
- **Coolors**
- **W3C Validator**
- **DevTools**
- **Lighthouse**
- **Balsamiq Wireframes**


## **Testing**

**Manual Testing**

Throughout the development process, the website was rigorously tested manually. Each feature was checked for functionality, and any issues encountered were promptly debugged. This included ensuring that all links worked correctly, forms submitted data as expected, and the layout was consistent across different screen sizes. Specific attention was given to resolving issues such as content overflow and ensuring that interactive elements were responsive.

**W3C Validation**

The HTML and CSS code were validated using the W3C Markup Validation Service and W3C CSS Validation Service, respectively. This helped identify and correct any syntax errors, ensuring that the code adhered to web standards and best practices.

**DevTools**

Browser DevTools were extensively used to inspect and debug the website. This included checking the DOM structure, monitoring network requests, and analyzing performance. DevTools were also used to test the responsiveness of the design by simulating different device screen sizes and orientations.

**Lighthouse**

Google Lighthouse was used to audit the website for performance, accessibility, best practices, and SEO. The tool provided valuable insights and recommendations, which were implemented to improve the overall quality of the website. Key metrics such as load time, accessibility scores, and adherence to best practices were optimized based on Lighthouse reports.
