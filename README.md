## **Website's name: One Horizon**

## **Introduction**

### **Project’s purpose**

This project’s objective is to generate a website that showcases intuitive and easy navigation, accessibility, responsive design and clear, well structured information.

It’s also an objective to test and validate the project using validators as W3C and Lighthouse to ensure responsiveness, accessibility, and consistency across the different devices and screen sizes.  

### **Website’s purpose**

The objective of the website is to provide key information about diversity and inclusion in the workplace/community for an unacquainted public in order to raise awareness and provide basic guidance to the public to promote such values and take action (this is for it’s MVP version).

During planning. other features were considered to  be implemented in further sprints.

## **Project’s Planning**


UX experience was taken into consideration for the design of the Project, making use of user stories to create a list of specific requirements and tasks which I elaborated into a project plan. I then filtered them down to get a brief that would fit the MPV's. 
Once this was achieved I moved on to create wireframes depicting an ideation for a multi-page website layout. However due to the limitations of the project's scope for this sprint and time, everything has been built into a single page. 

### **Project’s requirements**

 **External User’s Goal:**

The user wants to gain a basic understanding of diversity and inclusion in the workplace or educational environment. 
They seek straightforward information and tips presented in a clear, organised format.

**Site Owner’s Goal:**

The site owner aims to create a visually appealing, easy-to-navigate webpage that introduces diversity and inclusion concepts and offers basic guidance on how to implement these practices. 
The focus is on clear communication through effective use of HTML and CSS, utilising Bootstrap for layout and design.
